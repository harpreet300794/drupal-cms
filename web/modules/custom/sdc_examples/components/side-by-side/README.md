Demonstrates a "complex" component and represents different ways to pass inputs (props and slots) to children components.

## Usage
Use this component as a top level component.

## Additional info
In order to pass the image props, additional processing could be necessary.  Another approach to creating a similar component might use a slot for the image.  This would have the advantage of including features like lazy loading and responsive images without creating additional props.
